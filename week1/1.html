<p>Look!

    This day was the proudest day of my life.
    
    My sweet Penelope and the gods had
    
    given me a son.
    
    But at the same moment, the
    
    world we had built together
    
    was changed forever.
    
    Dark abord rent my new shores:
    
    My beloved Greece entered the war
    
    against Troy ...
    
    The most powerful of kings,
    
    Agamemnon and Menelaus himself,
    
    came for me.
    
    Bound by my oath of allegiance
    
    and honor me dictating to
    
    protect my country,</p>
